# 0x11. Python - Network #1

This repository contains Python scripts related to network communication and API interaction. These scripts are part of the curriculum for the ALX Software Engineering program.

# Learning Objectives
Upon completing this project, you should be able to:

- Fetch internet resources using the Python `urllib` package.
- Decode `urllib` body responses.
- Utilize the Python `requests` package for simpler HTTP requests.
- Make HTTP GET, POST, PUT, and other types of requests.
- Retrieve JSON resources and manipulate data from external services.

# Requirements
- Environment: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5
- Editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- File Structure: All files should end with a newline. The first line of each file should be `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- Code Style: Ensure compliance with `pycodestyle` (version 2.8.*).
- Execution: All files must be executable.
- Documentation: Each module should have documentation explaining its purpose.
- Module Access: Use `get` to access dictionary values by key.
- Import Restriction: Do not execute code when imported (`if __name__ == "__main__":`).
- Task Implementation: Task solutions should meet the specified learning objectives and plagiarism is strictly forbidden.

# Tasks
1. What's my status? #0: Fetches and displays status information from a URL using `urllib`.
2. Response header value #0: Displays the value of the X-Request-Id variable from the header of a URL response using `urllib`.
3. POST an email #0: Sends a POST request with an email parameter and displays the response using `urllib`.
4. Error code #0: Displays the body of a URL response and manages HTTP errors using `urllib`.
5. What's my status? #1: Fetches and displays status information from a URL using `requests`.
6. Response header value #1: Displays the value of the X-Request-Id variable from the header of a URL response using `requests`.
7. POST an email #1: Sends a POST request with an email parameter and displays the response using `requests`.
8. Error code #1: Displays the body of a URL response and manages HTTP errors using `requests`.
9. Search API: Sends a POST request with a letter parameter and processes the JSON response.
10. My GitHub!**: Uses GitHub API with Basic Authentication to display the user's ID.
