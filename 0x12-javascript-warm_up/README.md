# JavaScript Warm-up

This project consists of a series of JavaScript scripts designed to help you practice and understand fundamental concepts in JavaScript programming. Each script addresses specific tasks and learning objectives, allowing you to deepen your understanding of JavaScript syntax, control flow, functions, and more.

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Explain why JavaScript programming is powerful and versatile.
- Run JavaScript scripts using Node.js.
- Understand the differences between variables and constants (`var`, `let`, `const`).
- Identify and use various data types in JavaScript.
- Implement control flow structures such as `if`, `if...else`, loops (`while`, `for`), `break`, and `continue`.
- Define and use functions in JavaScript.
- Grasp the concept of variable scope.
- Perform arithmetic operations and manipulate dictionaries (objects).
- Import files in JavaScript.

## Project Structure
- **File Naming:** Each script is named according to its task number, such as `0-javascript_is_amazing.js`, `1-multi_languages.js`, etc.
- **Documentation:** A `README.md` file is provided at the root of the project directory to give an overview of the project and instructions on how to use the scripts.
- **Code Style:** All scripts adhere to the [semistandard](https://github.com/standard/semistandard) code style, ensuring consistency and readability.

## Setup and Usage
To run these scripts on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can install it using the following command:
    ```
    $ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -
    $ sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
    ```

2. Install the semistandard code style globally:
    ```
    $ sudo npm install semistandard --global
    ```

3. Clone the GitHub repository containing the project files.

4. Navigate to the `0x12-javascript-warm_up` directory.

5. Make sure all JavaScript files are executable:
    ```
    $ chmod +x *.js
    ```

6. Execute any script using Node.js. For example:
    ```
    $ ./0-javascript_is_amazing.js
    ```

## Task Overview
Each script tackles a specific task, ranging from basic print statements to more advanced functions and object manipulation. Here's a brief overview of each task:

1. Printing a simple message.
2. Printing multiple lines.
3. Handling command-line arguments.
4. Accessing and printing arguments.
5. Converting and printing integers.
6. Printing using arrays and loops.
7. Printing a message multiple times based on input.
8. Printing a square pattern based on input size.
9. Adding two integers using a function.
10. Computing the factorial of a number.
11. Finding the second largest integer from arguments.
12. Modifying object properties.
13. Creating and exporting a function.
14. Modifying variable scope.
15. Executing a function multiple times.
16. Incrementing and calling a function.
17. Adding a method to an object for incrementing.
