## Project Details

### Learning Objectives
Upon completing this project, you should be able to:

- Explain why JavaScript programming is valuable
- Create objects in JavaScript
- Understand the meaning of `this`
- Grasp the concept of `undefined`
- Appreciate the importance of variable types and scope
- Define closures and prototypes
- Inherit objects from one another

### Requirements
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Node.js (version 14.x)
- Code should be semistandard compliant with semicolons and adhere to AirBnB style
- All files must be executable
- Install Node.js 14 and semi-standard using the provided instructions
- Avoid using `var`

## Tasks
1. Rectangle #0: Define an empty class `Rectangle`.
2. Rectangle #1 Define a class `Rectangle` with width and height attributes.
3. Rectangle #2: Enhance Rectangle class to handle non-positive or non-integer width or height.
4. Rectangle #3: Add a `print()` method to Rectangle class to print the rectangle using 'X'.
5. Rectangle #4: Add `rotate()` and `double()` methods to Rectangle class.
6. Square #0: Define a class `Square` that inherits from Rectangle.
7. Square #1: Extend Square class with a method `charPrint(c)` to print the square using character `c`.
8. Occurrences: Write a function to count occurrences of an element in a list.
9. Esrever: Write a function to reverse a list without using the built-in `reverse` method.
10. Log me: Implement a function to log the number of arguments printed and their values.
11. Number conversion: Write a function to convert a number from base 10 to another base.
12. Factor index: Compute a new array where each value is multiplied by its index.
13. Sorted occurrences: Compute a dictionary of user IDs by occurrence from a dictionary of occurrences by user ID.
14. Concat files: Concatenate two files.

## Usage

To run any of the scripts, use the command:
